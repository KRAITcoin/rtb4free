RTB4FREE: Reach your audience
==========================================

Welcome to the `RTB4FREE`_ documentation hub.  Here you can find the online manual
and living documentation repository for RTB4FREE, the leading digital advertising
platform for businesses who want to reach their audience on the open web.

Living manual
    Documentation is updated in the same manner as code - and a build is made for
    each version of RTB4FREE.  You can easily view current and previous versions
    of documentation from this website.

International first
    While the english language version of the documentation is the reference version,
    other languages are available as well.  Our documentation is hosted in Github
    along with all other parts of our codebase - so you can update the doc in your
    favorite language and submit a pull request to keep it current.

Free and open source
    The documentation is built like our software - community driven, open source,
    free for all to view.
